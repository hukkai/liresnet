# üöÄ LiResNet: An Network Architecture for Training Certifiable Robust Models


This repository provides the implementation of our cutting-edge research on certifiable robust models. We proudly present the LiResNet model introduced at NeurIPS 2023 and its subsequent improvements now available as a preprint on arXiv. Our works are based on the training and certification schemes in [GloRo Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08452).

## üöÄ Getting Started:
- For training a model, check out our `run.sh` as a starting point.
- Dive into our [configs](/configs) for additional dataset configurations.

## üîú Upcoming Updates:
- A comprehensive README.
- Pre-trained model checkpoints.
